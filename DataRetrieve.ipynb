    "\n",
    "4. **Number of Rooms & Number of Bedrooms**: \n",
    "   - How big the house is. More rooms or bedrooms usually mean a higher rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Main Types of Heating & Fuel Types Used to Heat Dwellings**: \n",
    "   - How the house is warmed up. Some heating types might cost more or less. This can affect the rent price, especially in cold places.\n",

    "6. **Dwelling Occupancy Status for All Dwellings**: \n",
    "   - Tells if a house is currently lived in or empty. An empty house might be priced differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Access to Basic Amenities**: \n",
    "   - Important things a house has, like running water, electricity, or internet. Houses with more amenities might have higher rent.\n",

    "8. **Dwelling Dampness & Mould Indicator**: \n",
    "   - Signs if a house has moisture or mold problems. Houses with these issues might have lower rent because they can be unhealthy.\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Tenure of household, for households in occupied private dwellings**: \n",
    "   - This data indicates if homes are owned, rented, or under another type of tenure. High rental rates might show high mobility or high property purchase prices in an area, potentially affecting rental prices.\n",

    "**3. Sector of landlord, for households in rented occupied private dwellings**: \n",
    "   - This specifies if the landlord is an individual, a company, or a government entity. For instance, government-subsidized rents might be priced differently than those from private landlords.\n",

    "**4. Weekly rent paid by household, for households in rented occupied private dwellings**: \n",
    "   - A critical metric showing the weekly rent amounts paid by renters. This direct data will be a foundational piece for our rental price prediction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Number of motor vehicles, for households in occupied private dwellings**: \n",
    "   - This data shows the number of cars per household. It might indirectly hint at a household's socioeconomic level or the accessibility of public transport in an area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Access to telecommunication systems, for households in occupied private dwellings**: \n",
    "   - This metric indicates if a household has access to telecommunication systems like high-speed internet. In areas where remote work is essential, this might influence rental prices.\n",

    "1. **Religious Affiliation**: Gives insight into cultural diversity, but may not directly impact rental prices.\n",
    " \n",
    "2. **Cigarette Smoking Behaviour**: Likely not directly relevant to rental prices.\n",

    "3. **Health and Accessibility Metrics**: While these features (like difficulty in seeing or walking) show health trends, they may not have a direct relation to rental costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Relationship Status**: Provides insights into family demographics in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Individual Home Ownership**: Highly relevant. Areas with high homeownership might have different rental characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Number of Children Born**: Can influence demand for property type and size.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Education Metrics**: Locations near educational institutions or with a high student population might have specific rental demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Income Metrics**: Areas with higher incomes might exhibit higher rental prices. The source of income can offer additional insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Travel Means to Education**: Indicates transport infrastructure and proximity to educational establishments.\n",
