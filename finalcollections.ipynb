This lets the program act like a person using a web browser, scrolling through pages, waiting for new content to appear, and then grabbing the links to properties.\n",

    "The program is smart enough to handle lots of pages efficiently. Instead of going through each page one by one, it can work on several pages at the same time. This is done using something called multithreading, which is like having multiple hands all working together. And if the program runs into any problems, like a page not loading properly, it will try again a few times before moving on.\n",

It removes unnecessary information and changes the price details to simple numbers by getting rid of symbols and words. The program also checks details like the number of rooms and parking spaces, making sure they are in the right place and shown as numbers. It also looks for houses that come with or without furniture, marking them correctly. At the end, it changes the property type (like \"House\" or \"Apartment\") into a format that a computer can easily understand. If any type is missing, the program adds it. Now, the cleaned-up data is ready for more use, like studying or making predictions."

Cleaning techniques such as using pivot tables played and corrected instances of duplicate names and undertook reformatting measures. These steps ensure that the data is not only accurate but optimized for the model, making it better for efficient analysis."
